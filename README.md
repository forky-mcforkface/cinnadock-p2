CinnaDock++
===========

Fork of CinnaDock Plus by Entelechy to work with Cinnamon 2.4, 2.6.

Original description by Entelechy: 
This is a revamp of the CinnaDock extension by greg.  It uses the new settings API in Cinnamon 1.8+, and theming-wise blends in with Cinnamon.  CinnaDock Plus synchs pinned apps with the favorite-apps list.  Additionally I have incorporated some Win7-style functionality from elsewhere, namely window previews and close buttons.  See the file credits.txt for complete info about sources.  As CinnaDock Plus uses the new settings API, it will *not* work with Cinnamon 1.6 or earlier.

Version: 0.2
